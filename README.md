## Train
Run train.py to train the DQN agents and models are saved in ./simulations folder
## Check convergence (optional)
Run check_convergence.py to get the learning curve and neuron coefficients change in training.
## Test
Run test_delay_models.py to test multiple models under the same environment. (Optional)
Run test_1_model.py to test 1 model in a continously changing environment. (Optional)
Run test_compare_2_benchmark.py to compare the trained model with benchmark algorithms including FP(fractional programming) and wmmse.
## Generate figures
Run generate_result_for_models.py to generate result figures like figure1, figure2.
